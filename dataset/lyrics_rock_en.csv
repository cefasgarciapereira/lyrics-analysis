Wish You Were Here,Pink Floyd,"So, so you think you can tell Heaven from hell? Blue skies from pain? Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?

How I wish How I wish you were here We're just two lost souls Swimming in a fish bowl year after year Running over the same old ground What have we found? The same old fears Wish you were here","So, so you think you can tell Heaven from hell? Blue skies from pain? Can you tell a green field From a cold steel rail? A smile from a veil?

Faroeste Caboclo,Legião Urbana,"Não tinha medo o tal João de Santo Cristo Era o que todos diziam quando ele se perdeu Deixou pra trás todo o marasmo da fazenda Só pra sentir no seu sangue o ódio que Jesus lhe deu Quando criança, só pensava em ser bandido Ainda mais quando com um tiro de soldado o pai morreu Era o terror da sertania onde morava E na escola até o professor com ele aprendeu Ia pra igreja só pra roubar o dinheiro Que as velhinhas colocavam na caixinha do altar Sentia mesmo que era mesmo diferente Sentia que aquilo ali não era o seu lugar Ele queria sair para ver o mar E as coisas que ele via na televisão Juntou dinheiro para poder viajar De escolha própria, escolheu a solidão Comia todas as menininhas da cidade De tanto brincar de médico, aos doze, era professor Aos quinze, foi mandado pro reformatório Onde aumentou seu ódio diante de tanto terror Não entendia como a vida funcionava Discriminação por causa da sua classe e sua cor Ficou cansado de tentar achar resposta E comprou uma passagem, foi direto a Salvador E lá chegando, foi tomar um cafezinho E encontrou um boiadeiro com quem foi falar E o boiadeiro tinha uma passagem e ia perder a viagem Mas João foi lhe salvar Dizia ele: Estou indo pra Brasília Neste país lugar melhor não há Tô precisando visitar a minha filha Eu fico aqui e você vai no meu lugar E João aceitou sua proposta E num ônibus entrou no Planalto Central Ele ficou bestificado com a cidade Saindo da rodoviária, viu as luzes de Natal Meu Deus, mas que cidade linda No Ano Novo eu começo a trabalhar Cortar madeira, aprendiz de carpinteiro Ganhava cem mil por mês em Taguatinga Na sexta-feira, ia pra zona da cidade Gastar todo o seu dinheiro de rapaz trabalhador E conhecia muita gente interessante Até um neto bastardo do seu bisavô Um peruano que vivia na Bolívia E muitas coisas trazia de lá Seu nome era Pablo e ele dizia Que um negócio ele ia começar E Santo Cristo até a morte trabalhava Mas o dinheiro não dava pra ele se alimentar E ouvia às sete horas o noticiário Que sempre dizia que o seu ministro ia ajudar Mas ele não queria mais conversa E decidiu que, como Pablo, ele iria se virar Elaborou mais uma vez seu plano santo E, sem ser crucificado, a plantação foi começar Logo, logo os malucos da cidade souberam da novidade Tem bagulho bom aí E João de Santo Cristo ficou rico E acabou com todos os traficantes dali Fez amigos, frequentava a Asa Norte E ia pra festa de rock pra se libertar Mas de repente, sob uma má influência Dos boyzinhos da cidade, começou a roubar Já no primeiro roubo ele dançou E pro inferno ele foi pela primeira vez Violência e estupro do seu corpo Vocês vão ver, eu vou pegar vocês Agora o Santo Cristo era bandido Destemido e temido no Distrito Federal Não tinha nenhum medo de polícia Capitão ou traficante, playboy ou general Foi quando conheceu uma menina E de todos os seus pecados ele se arrependeu Maria Lúcia era uma menina linda E o coração dele pra ela o Santo Cristo prometeu Ele dizia que queria se casar E carpinteiro ele voltou a ser Maria Lúcia, pra sempre vou te amar E um filho com você eu quero ter O tempo passa e um dia vem na porta Um senhor de alta classe com dinheiro na mão E ele faz uma proposta indecorosa E diz que espera uma resposta Uma resposta do João Não boto bomba em banca de jornal Nem em colégio de criança, isso eu não faço, não E não protejo general de dez estrelas Que fica atrás da mesa com o cu na mão E é melhor o senhor sair da minha casa Nunca brinque com um Peixes de ascendente Escorpião Mas antes de sair, com ódio no olhar, o velho disse Você perdeu sua vida, meu irmão Você perdeu a sua vida, meu irmão Você perdeu a sua vida, meu irmão Essas palavras vão entrar no coração Eu vou sofrer as consequências como um cão Não é que o Santo Cristo estava certo? Seu futuro era incerto e ele não foi trabalhar Se embebedou e no meio da bebedeira Descobriu que tinha outro trabalhando em seu lugar Falou com Pablo que queria um parceiro E também tinha dinheiro e queria se armar Pablo trazia o contrabando da Bolívia E Santo Cristo revendia em Planaltina Mas acontece que um tal de Jeremias Traficante de renome, apareceu por lá Ficou sabendo dos planos de Santo Cristo E decidiu que com João ele ia acabar Mas Pablo trouxe uma Winchester 22 E Santo Cristo já sabia atirar E decidiu usar a arma só depois Que Jeremias começasse a brigar Jeremias, maconheiro sem-vergonha Organizou a Rockonha e fez todo mundo dançar Desvirginava mocinhas inocentes Se dizia que era crente, mas não sabia rezar E Santo Cristo há muito não ia pra casa E a saudade começou a apertar Eu vou-me embora, eu vou ver Maria Lúcia Já tá em tempo de a gente se casar Chegando em casa, então, ele chorou E pro inferno ele foi pela segunda vez Com Maria Lúcia, Jeremias se casou E um filho nela ele fez Santo Cristo era só ódio por dentro E então o Jeremias pra um duelo ele chamou Amanhã, às duas horas, na Ceilândia Em frente ao lote catorze, e é pra lá que eu vou E você pode escolher as suas armas Que eu acabo mesmo com você, seu porco traidor E mato também Maria Lúcia Aquela menina falsa pra quem jurei o meu amor E o Santo Cristo não sabia o que fazer Quando viu o repórter da televisão Que deu notícia do duelo na TV Dizendo a hora, e o local e a razão No sábado, então, às duas horas Todo o povo, sem demora, foi lá só para assistir Um homem que atirava pelas costas E acertou o Santo Cristo e começou a sorrir Sentindo o sangue na garganta João olhou pras bandeirinhas e pro povo a aplaudir E olhou pro sorveteiro e pras câmeras E a gente da TV que filmava tudo ali E se lembrou de quando era uma criança E de tudo o que vivera até ali E decidiu entrar de vez naquela dança Se a Via-Crúcis virou circo, estou aqui E nisso, o Sol cegou seus olhos E então Maria Lúcia ele reconheceu Ela trazia a Winchester 22 A arma que seu primo Pablo lhe deu Jeremias, eu sou homem, coisa que você não é E não atiro pelas costas, não Olha pra cá, filha da puta sem-vergonha Dá uma olhada no meu sangue e vem sentir o teu perdão E Santo Cristo, com a Winchester 22 Deu cinco tiros no bandido traidor Maria Lúcia se arrependeu depois E morreu junto com João, seu protetor O povo declarava que João de Santo Cristo Era santo porque sabia morrer E a alta burguesia da cidade Não acreditou na história que eles viram na TV E João não conseguiu o que queria Quando veio pra Brasília com o diabo ter Ele queria era falar pro presidente Pra ajudar toda essa gente que só faz Sofrer","That João de Santo Cristo wasn't afraid That's what everyone said when he got lost He left behind all the doldrums of the farm Just to feel in his blood the hatred that Jesus gave him As a child, he only thought about being a criminal Even more so when with a soldier shot his father died It was the terror of the countryside where he lived And at school even the teacher learned from him He went to church just to steal the money That the old ladies put in the altar box He really felt that it was really different He felt that it wasn't there it was his place He wanted to go out to see the sea And the things he saw on television He saved money to be able to travel By his own choice, he chose solitude He ate all the little girls in the city From playing so much doctor, at twelve, he was a teacher At fifteen , he was sent to the reformatory Where his hatred increased in the face of so much terror He didn't understand how life worked Discrimination because of his class and his color He got tired of trying to find an answer And he bought a ticket, went straight to Salvador And when he got there, he went to take a drink coffee And he met a cattle driver who he went to talk to And the cattle driver had a ticket and was going to miss the trip But João went to save him He said: I'm going to Brasília There's no better place in this country I need to visit my daughter I'll stay here and you go in my place And João accepted his proposal And on a bus he entered the Central Plateau He was amazed by the city Leaving the bus station, he saw the Christmas lights My God, what a beautiful city In the New Year I start working Chopping wood, carpenter's apprentice He earned a hundred thousand a month in Taguatinga On Friday, he went to the city area To spend all his money as a working boy And he met a lot of interesting people Even a bastard grandson of his great-grandfather A Peruvian who lived in Bolivia And he brought a lot of things from there His His name was Pablo and he said He was going to start a business And Santo Cristo worked until he died But the money wasn't enough to feed him And he listened to the news at seven o'clock That always said that his minister was going to help But he didn't want to talk anymore And he decided that, like Pablo, he would manage He created his holy plan once again And, without being crucified, the plantation began Soon, the city's crazy people soon heard about the news. There's good stuff there And João de Santo Cristo became rich And he ended all the drug dealers there He made friends, frequented Asa Norte And went to rock parties to free himself But suddenly, under the bad influence of the city's boys, he started stealing During the first robbery he danced And to hell he went for first time Violence and rape of your body You'll see, I'm going to catch you Now Santo Cristo was a criminal Fearless and feared in the Federal District He had no fear of the police Captain or drug dealer, playboy or general That's when he met a girl And of all his sins he repented Maria Lúcia was a beautiful girl And his heart for her the Holy Christ promised He said he wanted to get married And a carpenter he went back to being Maria Lúcia, I will love you forever And a child with you I want to have Time passes and one day a high-class gentleman comes to the door with money in his hand And he makes an unseemly proposal And says he expects a response A response from João I don't bomb a newsstand Not even a child's school, I don't do that , no And I don't protect a ten-star general Who sits behind the table with his ass in his hand And you better leave my house Never play with a Pisces with Scorpio ascendant But before leaving, with hatred in his eyes, the old man said You You lost your life, my brother You lost your life, my brother You lost your life, my brother These words will enter the heart I will suffer the consequences like a dog Isn't it that the Holy Christ was right? His future was uncertain and he didn't go to work He got drunk and in the middle of drinking He discovered that someone else was working in his place He spoke to Pablo that he wanted a partner And he also had money and wanted to arm himself Pablo brought contraband from Bolivia And Santo Cristo resold it in Planaltina But it turns out that a certain Jeremias, a renowned drug dealer, appeared there He found out about Santo Cristo's plans And decided that he was going to end up with João But Pablo brought a Winchester 22 And Santo Cristo already knew how to shoot And he decided to use the gun only after Jeremiah started to fight Jeremiah, a shameless stoner He organized the Rockonha and made everyone dance He degenerated innocent girls He said he was a believer, but he didn't know how to pray And Santo Cristo hadn't gone home for a long time And the longing started to get worse I'm leaving although, I'm going to see Maria Lúcia It's time for us to get married Arriving home, then, he cried And to hell he went for the second time With Maria Lúcia, Jeremias got married And he had a son with her Santo Cristo was just hate inside And then Jeremias called for a duel Tomorrow, at two o'clock, in Ceilândia In front of lot fourteen, and that's where I'm going And you can choose your weapons That I'll really finish you off, you traitorous pig And I also kill Maria Lúcia That fake girl to whom I swore my love And Santo Cristo didn't know what to do When he saw the television reporter Who reported the duel on TV Telling the time, the place and the reason On Saturday, then, at two o'clock All the people, without delay, went there just to watch A man who was shooting in the back And he hit Santo Cristo and started to smile Feeling the blood in his throat João looked at the flags and the people applauding And he looked at the ice cream man and the cameras And the TV people who filmed everything there And they remembered when they were children And everything they had experienced up until then And they decided to join that dance once and for all If the Via Crucis became a circus, I'm here And in that, the Sun blinded their eyes And then Maria Lúcia he recognized She was carrying the Winchester 22 The gun that his cousin Pablo gave him Jeremiah, I'm a man, which you're not And I don't shoot in the back, no Look here, shameless son of a bitch Give me a look at my blood and come and feel your forgiveness And Santo Cristo, with the Winchester 22 He fired five shots at the traitor bandit Maria Lúcia later repented And died together with João, her protector The people declared that João de Santo Cristo He was a saint because he knew how to die And the city's upper bourgeoisie didn't believe the story they saw on TV And João didn't get what he wanted When he came to Brasília with the devil he wanted to speak to the president To help all these people who only make them suffer",https://www.letras.mus.br/legiao-urbana/22492/

Será,Legião Urbana,"Tire suas mãos de mim Eu não pertenço a você Não é me dominando assim Que você vai me entender Eu posso estar sozinho Mas eu sei muito bem aonde estou Você pode até duvidar Acho que isso não é amor Será só imaginação? Será que nada vai acontecer? Será que é tudo isso em vão? Será que vamos conseguir vencer? Nos perderemos entre monstros Da nossa própria criação Serão noites inteiras Talvez com medo da escuridão Ficaremos acordados Imaginando alguma solução Pra que esse nosso egoísmo Não destrua o nosso coração Será só imaginação? Será que nada vai acontecer? Será que é tudo isso em vão? Será que vamos conseguir vencer? Brigar pra quê, se é sem querer? Quem é que vai nos proteger? Será que vamos ter de responder Pelos erros a mais, eu e você?","Take your hands off me I don't belong to you It's not dominating me like that That you will understand me I may be alone But I know very well where I am You may even doubt I think this is not love Is it just imagination? Will nothing happen? Is it all in vain? Will we be able to win? We will get lost among monsters Of our own creation It will be whole nights Maybe afraid of the darkness We will stay awake Imagining some solution So that our selfishness Does not destroy our heart Is it just imagination? Will nothing happen? Is it all in vain? Will we be able to win? Why fight, if it's unintentional? Who will protect us? Will we have to answer for the extra mistakes, you and me?",https://www.letras.mus.br/legiao-urbana/46977/

Because of you I could even be happy I would paint the whole sky red I would have more heirs than a rabbit I would accept life as it is I would travel on time to hell I would take a cold shower In winter I would change Even my name I would live On a hunger strike I would wish all day The same woman For you!

American Pie,Don McLean,"A long, long time ago I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died So bye bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye Singin': This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so? Now do you believe in rock'n roll? Can music save your mortal soul? And can you teach me how to dance real slow? Well, I know that you're in love with him 'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym You both kicked off your shoes Man, I dig those rhythm and blues I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck With a pink carnation and a pickup truck But I knew I was out of luck The day the music died I started singin': Bye bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey 'n rye And singin': This’ll be the day that I die This’ll be the day that I die Now, for ten years we've been on our own And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone But that's not how it used to be When the jester sang for the king and queen In a coat he borrowed from James Dean And a voice that came from you and me Oh, and while the king was looking down The jester stole his thorny crown The courtroom was adjourned No verdict was returned And while Lennon read a book on Marx The quartet practiced in the park And we sang dirges in the dark The day the music died We were singin': Bye bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye And singin': This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Helter Skelter in a summer swelter The birds flew off with a fallout shelter Eight miles high and fallin' fast It landed foul on the grass The players tried for a forward pass With the jester on the sidelines in a cast Now, the half-time air was sweet perfume While the sergeants played a marching tune We all got up to dance Oh, but we never got the chance 'Cause the players tried to take the field The marching band refused to yield Do you recall what was revealed The day the music died? We started singin': Bye bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye And singin': This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Oh, and there we were, all in one place A generation lost in space With no time left to start again So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick Jack Flash sat on a candlestick 'Cause fire is the devil’s only friend Oh, and as I watched him on the stage My hands were clenched in fists of rage No angel born in hell Could break that Satan's spell And as the flames climbed high into the night To light the sacrificial rite I saw Satan laughing with delight The day the music died We were singin': Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye And singin': This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die I met a girl who sang the blues And I asked her for some happy news But she just smiled and turned away I went down to the sacred store Where I'd heard the music years before But the man there said the music wouldn't play And in the streets, the children screamed The lovers cried and the poets dreamed But not a word was spoken The church bells all were broken And the three men I admire most The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost They caught the last train for the coast The day the music died And they were singin': Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye Singin': This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die They were singin': Bye bye Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry Them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey'n rye Singin': This'll be the day that I die","A long, long time ago I can still remember How that music used to make me smile And I knew if I had my chance That I could make those people dance And maybe they'd be happy for a while But February made me shiver With every paper I'd deliver Bad news on the doorstep I couldn't take one more step I can't remember if I cried When I read about his widowed bride But something touched me deep inside The day the music died So bye bye, Miss American Pie Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry And them good old boys were drinking whiskey 'n rye Singin': This'll be the day that I die This'll be the day that I die Did you write the book of love And do you have faith in God above If the Bible tells you so?

Pedro, onde cê vai eu também vou Pedro, onde cê vai eu também vou Mas tudo acaba onde começou É que tudo acaba onde começou","Many times, Pedro, you talk Always complaining about loneliness Who made you with iron, made you with fire, Pedro It's a shame you don't know Go to your job every day Not knowing if it's good or bad When you want to cry, go to the bathroom Pedro, things aren't quite like that Every time I feel like paradise Or I burn like hell in hell I think of you, my poor friend Who always only wears the shitty suit Pedro, where are you going, I'm going too Pedro, where are you I'm going too But everything ends where it started Try to teach me about your things That life is serious and war is hard But if you can't, shut up, Pedro And let me live my madness I remember, Pedro, those old days When the two thought about the world Today I call you a careta, Pedro And you call me a bum Pedro, where you go I go too Pedro, where you go I go too But everything ends where it started All the paths are the same What leads to glory or to perdition There are so many paths, so many doors But only one has a heart And I have nothing to say to you But don't criticize me as I am Each one of us is a universe, Pedro Where you go, I go too Oh! Yes! Pedro, where you go I go too Pedro, where you go I go too But everything ends where it started It's just that everything ends where it started",https://www.letras.mus.br/raul-seixas/48318/

Marvin,Titãs,"Meu pai não tinha educação Ainda me lembro, era um grande coração Ganhava a vida com muito suor E mesmo assim não podia ser pior Pouco dinheiro pra poder pagar Todas as contas e despesas do lar Mas Deus quis vê-lo no chão com as mãos Levantadas pro céu, implorando perdão Chorei, meu pai disse: Boa sorte Com a mão no meu ombro, em seu leito de morte E disse: Marvin Agora é só você E não vai adiantar Chorar vai me fazer sofrer E três dias depois de morrer Meu pai, eu queria saber Mas não botava nem os pés na escola Mamãe lembrava disso a toda hora E todo dia antes do Sol sair Eu trabalhava sem me distrair Às vezes acho que não vai dar pé Eu queria fugir, mas onde eu estiver Eu sei muito bem o que ele quis dizer Meu pai, eu me lembro Não me deixa esquecer Ele disse: Marvin A vida é pra valer Eu fiz o meu melhor E o seu destino eu sei de cor E então um dia uma forte chuva veio E acabou com o trabalho de um ano inteiro E aos treze anos de idade eu sentia Todo o peso do mundo em minhas costas Eu queria jogar, mas perdi a aposta E trabalhava feito um burro nos campos Só via carne se roubasse um frango Meu pai cuidava de toda a família Sem perceber, segui a mesma trilha E toda noite minha mãe orava Deus, era em nome da fome que eu roubava Dez anos passaram, cresceram meus irmãos E os anjos levaram minha mãe pelas mãos Chorei, meu pai disse: Boa sorte Com a mão no meu ombro, em seu leito de morte E disse: Marvin Agora é só você E não vai adiantar Chorar vai me fazer sofrer Marvin A vida é pra valer Eu fiz o meu melhor E o seu destino eu sei de cor Marvin Agora é só você E não vai adiantar Chorar vai me fazer sofrer Marvin A vida é pra valer Eu fiz o meu melhor E o seu destino eu sei de cor","My father had no education I still remember, he had a big heart He earned his living with a lot of sweat And even so it couldn't be worse Little money to pay All the bills and household expenses But God wanted to see him on the floor with his hands raised to heaven, begging for forgiveness I cried, my father said: Good luck With his hand on my shoulder, on his deathbed And he said: Marvin Now it's just you And it won't help Crying will make me suffer And three days after I die My father , I wanted to know But I didn't even set foot in school Mom remembered that all the time And every day before the sun came out I worked without being distracted Sometimes I think I won't be able to stand I wanted to run away, but wherever I am I know very well What did he mean My father, I remember Don't let me forget He said: Marvin Life is for real I did my best And your destiny I know by heart And then one day a heavy rain came And ended the work of a whole year And at thirteen years of age I felt the entire weight of the world on my back I wanted to play, but I lost the bet And I worked like a donkey in the fields I only saw meat if I stole a chicken My father took care of the whole family Without I realized, I followed the same path And every night my mother prayed to God, it was in the name of hunger that I stole Ten years passed, my brothers grew up And the angels took my mother by the hands I cried, my father said: Good luck With your hand in mine shoulder, on his deathbed And he said: Marvin Now it's just you And it won't help Crying will make me suffer Marvin Life is for real I did my best And your destiny I know by heart Marvin Now it's just you And no It will help Crying will make me suffer Marvin Life is for real I did my best And I know your destiny by heart",https://www.letras.mus.br/titas/40321/

Given To Fly,Pearl Jam,"He could have tuned in Tuned in, but he tuned out A bad time, nothing could save him Alone in a corridor, waiting, locked out He got up out of there Ran for hundreds of miles He made it to the ocean Had a smoke in a tree The wind rose up Set him down on his knee Wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw Delivered him wings: Hey, look at me now Arms wide open with the sea as his floor Oh, oh, ooh He's Flying! Woah! High! Wide! Whole! He floated back down 'Cause he wanted to share His key to the locks on the chains He saw everywhere But first he was stripped And then he was stabbed By faceless men, well fuckers He still stands And he still gives his love He just gives it away The love he receives Is the love that is saved And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky A human being that was given to fly Flying!

I said it and even then you couldn't help it Because I told you so much You subverted what was a feeling and so You made it a reason to get lost In the abyss that is thinking and feeling She's more sentimental than me So it's okay If I suffer a little more (If she talks to you like that, with so many detours It's to seduce you and see you looking for the meaning Of what you would hear carelessly If she were direct to you, you would reject her) I only accept the condition of having you all to myself I know, no It's like that, but let me I only accept the condition of having you all to myself I know, it's not like that, but let me pretend and laugh",https://www.letras.mus.br/los-hermanos/67390/

Último Romance,Los Hermanos,"Eu encontrei-a quando não quis Mais procurar o meu amor E quanto levou foi pra eu merecer Antes um mês e eu já não sei E até quem me vê lendo o jornal Na fila do pão, sabe que eu te encontrei E ninguém dirá que é tarde demais Que é tão diferente assim Do nosso amor a gente é que sabe, pequena Ah, vai Me diz o que é o sufoco Que eu te mostro alguém A fim de te acompanhar E se o caso for de ir à praia Eu levo essa casa numa sacola Eu encontrei-a e quis duvidar Tanto clichê, deve não ser Você me falou pra eu não me preocupar Ter fé e ver coragem no amor E só de te ver, eu penso em trocar A minha TV, num jeito de te levar A qualquer lugar que você queira E ir aonde o vento for Que pra nós dois Sair de casa já é se aventurar Ah, vai Me diz o que é o sossego Que eu te mostro alguém A fim de te acompanhar E se o tempo for te levar Eu sigo essa hora, pego carona Pra te acompanhar","I found her when I didn't want to look for my love anymore And how long it took for me to deserve it Before a month and I no longer know And even those who see me reading the newspaper In the bread line, know that I found you And no one will say that it is too late That it's so different We're the ones who know about our love, little one Ah, come on, tell me what's difficult So I'll show you someone In order to accompany you And if it's a case of going to the beach, I'll take you to this house in a bag I found it and wanted to doubt So much of a cliché, it must not be You told me not to worry Have faith and see courage in love And just seeing you, I think about changing My TV, in a way to take you A anywhere you want And go wherever the wind is That for both of us Leaving home is already an adventure Oh, go Tell me what peace is So I can show you someone In order to accompany you And if time takes you I I follow this time, I get a ride to accompany you",https://www.letras.mus.br/los-hermanos/67547/

Senhor do Tempo,Charlie Brown Jr.,"Eu não sou o senhor do tempo, mas eu sei que vai chover Me sinto muito bem quando fico com você Eu tenho habilidade de fazer histórias tristes Virarem melodia, vou vivendo o dia a dia Na paz, na moral, na humilde, busco só sabedoria Aprendendo todo dia, me espelho em você Corro junto com você, vivo junto com você Faço tudo por você Seguindo em frente com fé e atenção Continuo na missão, continuo por você e por mim Porque quando a casa cai Não dá pra fraquejar, quem é guerreiro tá ligado Que guerreiro é assim O tempo passa e um dia a gente aprende Hoje eu sei realmente o que faz a minha mente Eu vi o tempo passar, vi pouca coisa mudar Então, tomei um caminho diferente Tanta gente equivocada faz mal uso da palavra Falam, falam o tempo todo, mas não tem nada a dizer Mas eu tenho santo forte, é incrível a minha sorte Agradeço todo tempo por ter encontrado você O tempo é rei e a vida é uma lição E um dia a gente cresce E conhece nossa essência e ganha experiência E aprende o que é raiz, então cria consciência Tem gente que reclama da vida o tempo todo Mas a lei da vida é quem dita o fim do jogo Eu vi de perto o que neguinho é capaz por dinheiro Eu conheci o próprio lobo na pele de um cordeiro Infelizmente a gente tem que tá ligado o tempo inteiro Ligado nos pilantra e também nos bagunceiro E a gente se pergunta por que a vida é assim? É difícil pra você e é difícil pra mim Eu não sou o senhor do tempo, mas eu sei que vai chover Me sinto muito bem quando fico com você Eu tenho habilidade de fazer histórias tristes Virarem melodia, vou vivendo o dia a dia Na paz, na moral, na humilde, busco só sabedoria Aprendendo todo dia, me espelho em você Corro junto com você, vivo junto com você, faço tudo por você Vivendo nesse mundo louco, hoje só na brisa Viver pra ser melhor também é jeito de levar a vida O tempo passa e um dia a gente aprende Hoje eu sei realmente o que faz a minha mente Eu vi o tempo passar e pouca coisa mudar Então, tomei um caminho diferente Tanta gente equivocada faz mal uso da palavra Falam, falam o tempo todo, mas não tem nada a dizer Mas eu tenho santo forte, é incrível a minha sorte Agradeço todo tempo ter encontrado você Vem que o bom astral vai dominar o mundo Eu já briguei com a vida, hoje eu vivo bem com todo mundo aí Na maior moral Charlie Brown!

Infinita Highway,Engenheiros do Hawaii,"Você me faz correr demais Os riscos desta highway Você me faz correr atrás Do horizonte desta highway Ninguém por perto, silêncio no deserto Deserta highway Estamos sós e nenhum de nós Sabe exatamente onde vai parar Mas não precisamos saber pra onde vamos Nós só precisamos ir Não queremos ter o que não temos Nós só queremos viver Sem motivos, nem objetivos Estamos vivos e isto é tudo É sobretudo a lei Da infinita highway Quando eu vivia e morria na cidade Eu não tinha nada, nada a temer Mas eu tinha medo, medo desta estrada Olhe só! Veja você Quando eu vivia e morria na cidade Eu tinha de tudo, tudo ao meu redor Mas tudo o que eu sentia era que algo me faltava E à noite eu acordava banhado em suor Não queremos lembrar o que esquecemos Nós só queremos viver Não queremos aprender o que sabemos Não queremos nem saber Sem motivos, nem objetivos Estamos vivos e é só Só obedecemos a lei Da infinita highway Escute garota, o vento canta uma canção Dessas que a gente nunca canta sem razão Me diga, garota: Será a estrada uma prisão? Eu acho que sim, você finge que não Mas nem por isso ficaremos parados Com a cabeça nas nuvens e os pés no chão Tudo bem, garota, não adianta mesmo ser livre Se tanta gente vive sem ter como viver Estamos sós e nenhum de nós Sabe onde quer chegar Estamos vivos sem motivos Que motivos temos pra estar? Atrás de palavras escondidas Nas entrelinhas do horizonte Dessa highway Silenciosa highway (highway) Eu vejo um horizonte trêmulo Eu tenho os olhos úmidos Eu posso estar completamente enganado Eu posso estar correndo pro lado errado Mas a dúvida é o preço da pureza E é inútil ter certeza Eu vejo as placas dizendo Não corra, não morra, não fume Eu vejo as placas cortando o horizonte Elas parecem facas de dois gumes Minha vida é tão confusa quanto a América central Por isso não me acuse de ser irracional Escute garota Façamos um trato Você desliga o telefone Se eu ficar muito abstrato Eu posso ser um beatle Um beatnik ou um bitolado Mas eu não sou ator Eu não tô à toa do teu lado Por isso, garota Façamos um pacto De não usar a highway Pra causar impacto Cento e dez Cento e vinte Cento e sessenta Só pra ver até quando O motor aguenta Na boca, em vez de um beijo Um chiclet de menta E a sombra do sorriso que eu deixei Numa das curvas da highway (highway) Highway (highway) Infinita highway (highway) Highway (highway) Infinita highway (highway) Highway (highway) Highway (highway) Highway (highway)","You make me run too much The risks of this highway You make me chase The horizon of this highway No one around, silence in the desert Deserted highway We're alone and none of us Know exactly where we're going to end But we don't need to know where we're going We just need to go No we want to have what we don't have We just want to live Without reasons or goals We are alive and that's all It's above all the law Of the infinite highway When I lived and died in the city I had nothing, nothing to fear But I was afraid, afraid of this road Look!

I think so, you pretend not to But that doesn't mean we'll stand still With our heads in the clouds and our feet on the ground It's okay, girl, there's no point in being free If so many people live without having a way to live We're alone and none of us Know where do you want to go We are alive without reasons What reasons do we have to be?

Ouro de Tolo,Raul Seixas,"Eu devia estar contente Porque eu tenho um emprego Sou um dito cidadão respeitável E ganho quatro mil cruzeiros Por mês Eu devia agradecer ao Senhor Por ter tido sucesso Na vida como artista Eu devia estar feliz Porque consegui comprar Um Corcel 73 Eu devia estar alegre E satisfeito Por morar em Ipanema Depois de ter passado fome Por dois anos Aqui na Cidade Maravilhosa Ah!

Próximo ano? Cebolinha com seus planos Infalíveis ia me ensinar a ser Forte, corajoso, bom de bola Um dos bonitos da escola Muito embora eu nem fizesse questão Ainda bem que eu sou brasileiro Tão teimoso, esperançoso Orgulhoso de ser pentacampeão Já que se eu fosse americano Pegaria uma pistola E a cabeça ia perder a razão: Mataria quinze na escola Estouraria a caixola E apareceria na televisão E por fim cresci, de insulto em insulto Eu me vi como um adulto Culto, pronto pra o que mesmo? Já nem sei. Olho e não encontro Penso se eu não fui um tonto De acreditar no conto Do vigário que escutei Não tem carro me esperando Não tem mesa reservada Só uma piada sem graça de português Não tem vinho nem champanhe ou taça Só um dedo de cachaça E um troco magro todo fim de mês Tudo que eu sempre sonhei Tanto que eu consegui É tão bom estar aqui Quanto ainda está por vir Tudo que eu sempre sonhei Tanto que eu consegui É tão bom estar aqui Mas bobagem, quanta amargura Eu já sei que a vida é dura Agora é pura questão de se acostumar Basta ter coragem e finura E o jogo de cintura Aprendido dia a dia, bar em bar Pra que reclamar se tem conhaque Se na tevê tem um craque E o meu timão só entra pra ganhar? Pra que imitar Chico Buarque Pra que querer ser um mártir Se faz parte do momento se entregar? E por fim tem até namorada Bonitinha, educada Séria, tudo o que mamãe vive a pedir Tem beijinho e também trepada E a consciência pesada A cada nova vontadinha que surgir De outra mulher, de liberdade De um amor de verdade De poder fechar os olhos e sorrir Pensando que então, dali pra frente Seja qual for tua idade O melhor ainda vai estar por vir!

Next year? Cebolinha with his infallible plans was going to teach me to be Strong, courageous, good at ball One of the cute ones at school Even though I didn't even care about it Good thing I'm Brazilian So stubborn, hopeful Proud to be a five-time champion Since if I were American I would get one pistol And my head would lose its reason: I would kill fifteen people at school I would blow up the box And appear on television And finally I grew up, from insult to insult I saw myself as an educated adult, ready for what? I don't even know anymore. I look and I can't find it I wonder if I wasn't a fool To believe the vicar's story that I heard There's no car waiting for me There's no reserved table Just a dull Portuguese joke There's no wine, no champagne or glass Just a finger of cachaça And some change thin every end of the month Everything I've ever dreamed of So much that I've achieved It's so good to be here How much is yet to come Everything I've ever dreamed of So much that I've achieved It's so good to be here But nonsense, so much bitterness I already know that life is It's tough Now it's just a matter of getting used to it You just need to have courage and finesse And the flexibility to learn day by day, bar by bar Why complain if there's cognac If there's a star on TV And my helm only comes in to win? Why imitate Chico Buarque Why want to be a martyr If it's part of the moment to surrender? And finally he even has a girlfriend Cute, educated Serious, everything that mom keeps asking for There's a kiss and also a fuck And a guilty conscience With each new desire that arises From another woman, from freedom From a real love To be able to close your eyes and smile Thinking that from then on, whatever your age, the best is yet to come!

Gita,Raul Seixas,"Eu, que já andei pelos quatro cantos do mundo procurando Foi justamente num sonho que Ele me falou Às vezes você me pergunta Por que é que eu sou tão calado Não falo de amor quase nada Nem fico sorrindo ao teu lado Você pensa em mim toda hora Me come, me cospe, me deixa Talvez você não entenda Mas hoje eu vou lhe mostrar Eu sou a luz das estrelas Eu sou a cor do luar Eu sou as coisas da vida Eu sou o medo de amar Eu sou o medo do fraco A força da imaginação O blefe do jogador Eu sou, eu fui, eu vou (Gita! Gita! Gita! Gita! Gita!) Eu sou o seu sacrifício A placa de contramão O sangue no olhar do vampiro E as juras de maldição Eu sou a vela que acende Eu sou a luz que se apaga Eu sou a beira do abismo Eu sou o tudo e o nada Por que você me pergunta? Perguntas não vão lhe mostrar Que eu sou feito da terra Do fogo, da água e do ar Você me tem todo dia Mas não sabe se é bom ou ruim Mas saiba que eu estou em você Mas você não está em mim Das telhas, eu sou o telhado A pesca do pescador A letra A tem meu nome Dos sonhos, eu sou o amor Eu sou a dona de casa Nos pegue-pagues do mundo Eu sou a mão do carrasco Sou raso, largo, profundo (Gita! Gita! Gita! Gita! Gita!) Eu sou a mosca da sopa E o dente do tubarão Eu sou os olhos do cego E a cegueira da visão Eu, mas eu sou o amargo da língua A mãe, o pai e o avô O filho que ainda não veio O início, o fim e o meio O início, o fim e o meio Eu sou o início, o fim e o meio Eu sou o início, o fim e o meio","I, who have already walked the four corners of the world searching It was precisely in a dream that He spoke to me Sometimes you ask me Why am I so silent I don't talk about love almost at all I don't even smile at your side You think about me all the time Eat me, spit me out, leave me Maybe you don't understand But today I'm going to show you I am the light of the stars I am the color of the moonlight I am the things in life I am the fear of loving I am the fear of the weak The strength of imagination The gambler's bluff I am, I was, I will (Gita! Gita! Gita! Gita! Gita!) I am your sacrifice The counter sign The blood in the vampire's eyes And the curse oaths I am the candle that turns on I am the light that goes out I am the edge of the abyss I am everything and nothing Why do you ask me? Questions won't show you That I'm made of the earth Of fire, water and air You have me every day But you don't know if it's good or bad But know that I'm in you But you're not in me Of the tiles, I am the roof The fisherman's catch The letter A has my name From dreams, I am love I am the housewife In the take-aways of the world I am the executioner's hand I am shallow, wide, deep (Gita! Gita! Gita! Gita! Gita!) I am the fly in the soup And the tooth of the shark I am the eyes of the blind And the blindness of vision Me, but I am the bitterness of the tongue The mother, the father and the grandfather The son who has not yet come The beginning, the end and the middle The beginning, the end and the middle I am the beginning, the end and the middle I am the beginning, the end and the middle",https://www.letras.mus.br/raul-seixas/48312/

Quase Sem Querer,Legião Urbana,"Tenho andado distraído Impaciente e indeciso E ainda estou confuso, só que agora é diferente Estou tão tranquilo e tão contente Quantas chances desperdicei Quando o que eu mais queria Era provar pra todo o mundo Que eu não precisava provar nada pra ninguém Me fiz em mil pedaços pra você juntar E queria sempre achar explicação pro que eu sentia Como um anjo caído, fiz questão de esquecer Que mentir pra si mesmo é sempre a pior mentira Mas não sou mais tão criança Oh, oh A ponto de saber tudo Já não me preocupo se eu não sei por que Às vezes, o que eu vejo, quase ninguém vê E eu sei que você sabe quase sem querer Que eu vejo o mesmo que você Tão correto e tão bonito O infinito é realmente um dos deuses mais lindos Sei que às vezes uso palavras repetidas Mas quais são as palavras que nunca são ditas? Me disseram que você Estava chorando E foi então que eu percebi Como lhe quero tanto Já não me preocupo se eu não sei por que Às vezes, o que eu vejo, quase ninguém vê E eu sei que você sabe quase sem querer Que eu quero o mesmo que você","I've been distracted Impatient and indecisive And I'm still confused, but now it's different I'm so calm and so happy How many chances I wasted When what I wanted most Was to prove to everyone That I didn't need to prove anything to anyone I was left in a thousand pieces for you to join And I always wanted to find an explanation for what I felt Like a fallen angel, I made a point of forgetting That lying to yourself is always the worst lie But I'm not such a child anymore Oh, oh To the point of knowing everything I no longer worry if I don't know why Sometimes, what I see, almost no one sees And I know that you know almost without wanting to That I see the same as you So correct and so beautiful Infinity is truly one of the most beautiful gods I know that sometimes I use repeated words But what are the words that are never said?

E ela se formou no mesmo mês Que ele passou no vestibular E os dois comemoraram juntos E também brigaram juntos muitas vezes depois E todo mundo diz que ele completa ela E vice-versa, que nem feijão com arroz Construíram uma casa há uns dois anos atrás Mais ou menos quando os gêmeos vieram Batalharam grana, seguraram legal A barra mais pesada que tiveram Eduardo e Mônica voltaram pra Brasília E a nossa amizade dá saudade no verão Só que nessas férias, não vão viajar Porque o filhinho do Eduardo tá de recuperação E quem um dia irá dizer Que existe razão Nas coisas feitas pelo coração?

And she graduated in the same month That he passed the entrance exam And the two celebrated together And they also fought together many times afterwards And everyone says he completes her And vice versa, like rice and beans They built a house about two years ago Around the same time the twins came They fought money, they held it together nicely The hardest thing they had Eduardo and Mônica went back to Brasília And our friendship is missed in the summer But during these holidays, they won't travel Because Eduardo's little son is recovering And who will one day say That there is a reason in things done from the heart?

Bed Of Roses,Bon Jovi,"Sitting here, wasted and wounded At this old piano Trying hard to capture the moment This morning, I don't know 'Cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head And some blonde gave me nightmares I think that she's still in my bed As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head While we're talking About all of the things that I long to believe About love, the truth, what you mean to me And the truth is Baby, you're all that I need I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on a bed of roses Well, I'm so far away Each step that I take is on my way home A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you I'll just close my eyes and whisper Baby, blind love is true I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on a bed of roses Well, this hotel bar's hangover, whiskey's gone dry The barkeeper's wig's crooked And she's giving me the eye I might have said: Yeah But I laughed so hard I think I died Oh, yeah Now, as you close your eyes Know I'll be thinking about you While my mistress, she calls me To stand in her spotlight again Tonight I won't be alone But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove For it's you that I'd die to defend I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on a bed of roses","Sitting here, wasted and wounded At this old piano Trying hard to capture the moment This morning, I don't know 'Cause a bottle of vodka is still lodged in my head And some blonde gave me nightmares I think that she's still in my bed As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead With an ironclad fist I wake up and French kiss the morning While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head While we're talking About all of the things that I long to believe About love, the truth, what you mean to me And the truth is Baby, you're all that I need I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on a bed of roses Well, I'm so far away Each step that I take is on my way home A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you I'll just close my eyes and whisper Baby, blind love is true I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down on a bed of roses Well, this hotel bar's hangover, whiskey's gone dry The barkeeper's wig's crooked And she's giving me the eye I might have said: Yeah But I laughed so hard I think I died Oh, yeah Now, as you close your eyes Know I'll be thinking about you While my mistress, she calls me To stand in her spotlight again Tonight I won't be alone But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely I've got nothing to prove For it's you that I'd die to defend I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails Oh, I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lay you down I wanna lay you down in a bed of roses For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is And lays you down on a bed of roses",https://www.letras.mus.br/bon-jovi/4928/

Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true When will you realize Vienna waits for you?
