Patches,Clarence Carter,"I was born and raised down in Alabama On a farm way back up in the woods I was so ragged, folks used to call me Patches Papa used to tease me 'bout it Of course deep down inside he was hurt 'Cause he'd done all he could My papa was a great ol' man I can see him with a shovel in his hand See, education he never had But he did wonders when the time got bad The little money from the crops he raised Barely paid the bills we made Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground When he tried to get up, life would kick him back down One day papa called me to his dyin' bed Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said He said: Patches I'm dependin' on you, son To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you Two days later papa passed away And I became a man that day So I told mama I was gonna quit school But she said that was daddy's strictest rule So every morning 'fore I went to school I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on I wanted to leave, just run away from home But I would remember what my daddy said With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed He said: Patches I'm dependin' on you, son I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest But then one day a strong rain came And washed all the crops away And at the age of 13 I thought I was carryin' the weight of the whole world on my shoulders And you know mama knew what I was going through 'Cause every day I had to work the fields 'Cause that's the only way we got our meals You see, I was the oldest of the family And everybody else depended on me Every night I heard my mama pray Lord, give him strength to make another day So years have passed and all the kids have grown The angels took mama to a brand new home God knows people, I shredded tears But my daddy's voice kept me through the years Sayin': Patches I'm dependin' on you, son To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you I can still hear papa when he said: Patches I'm dependin' on you, son I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest I can still hear papa when he said: Patches I'm dependin' on you, son To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you","I was born and raised down in Alabama On a farm way back up in the woods I was so ragged, folks used to call me Patches Papa used to tease me 'bout it Of course deep down inside he was hurt 'Cause he'd done all he could My papa was a great ol' man I can see him with a shovel in his hand See, education he never had But he did wonders when the time got bad The little money from the crops he raised Barely paid the bills we made Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground When he tried to get up, life would kick him back down One day papa called me to his dyin' bed Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said He said: Patches I' m dependin' on you, son To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you Two days later papa passed away And I became a man that day So I told mama I was gonna quit school But she said that was daddy's strictest rule So every morning 'fore I went to school I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on I wanted to leave, just run away from home But I would remember what my daddy said With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed He said: Patches I'm dependent on you, son I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest But then one day a strong rain came And washed all the crops away And at the age of 13 I thought I was carryingin' the weight of the whole world on my shoulders And you know mama knew what I was going through 'Cause every day I had to work the fields 'Cause that's the only way we got our meals You see, I was the oldest of the family And everybody else depended on me Every night I heard my mama pray Lord, give him strength to make another day So years have passed and all the kids have grown The angels took mama to a brand new home God knows people, I shredded tears But my daddy's voice kept me through the years Sayin': Patches I'm depending on you, son To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you I can still hear papa when he said: Patches I'm depending on you, son I tried to do my best It's up to you to do the rest I can still hear papa when he said: Patches I'm depending on you, son To pull the family through My son, it's all left up to you",https://www.letras.mus.br/clarence-carter/505651/

The Guardian (Ellie's Song),Shawn James,"When does it get quiet? Time was supposed to extinguish the desire But the embers won't snuff out Haunted by your smiles The mask keeps getting heavier One step forward, two steps back There's a noose round my neck and the further I get It's harder & harder to breathe Can I find a way to cut the rope? I've been waiting for dawn But the light is all gone Don't know if I'm already blind Can I leave it all behind? What's it really for if it's not yours and it's not mine? This victory is not what I hoped for How was I to know that everything would end up like this? Survival of the fittest of sorts So I've become the bringer of death A lover of life The one who guards from the dark of the night I'll be the hammer of war Justice & mercy don't live side by side So in retribution I abide I'll tip the scales to justice's end but can it make amends? Kill or be killed What a way to live & die I just can't see this cycle ever ending How can I correct the damage done  When I can't feel the consequences of my recourse So I've become the bringer of death A lover of life The one who guards from the dark of the night I'll be the hammer of war I've been waiting for dawn But the light is all gone Don't know if I'm already blind Can I leave it all behind?","When does it get quiet?

One Chance,Eric Clapton,"Without wishing to cause you any pain, I got to push on through, babe, And if I take the chance of seeing you again, I just don't know what I would do, baby.

You had one chance and you blew it. You may never get another chance. You had the floor and you knew it. You can't blame it on your circumstance. At the risk of causing you a little pain, I'm going to have to forget you, babe, 'Cause you broke my heart, left it out in the rain And you'd do the same again if I let you, babe. I would give anything to hold you in my arms, But you know I can't do that, baby. I guess I'll have to live with the choice that I have made Even though deep down I still suspect that I blew it.","Without wishing to cause you any pain, I got to push on through, babe, And if I took the chance of seeing you again, I just don't know what I would do, baby.

I got daisies In green pastures, I got my man/girl Who could ask for anything more ? Ol'Man Trouble, I don't mind him. You won't find him 'Round my door. I got starlight, I got sweet dreams, I got my man/girl, Who could ask for anything more ? Who could ask for anything more ? (bis)","Days can be sunny, With never a sigh;  Don't need what money can buy. Birds in the tree sing Their dayful of song, Why shouldn't we sing along ? I'm a chipper all the day, Happy with my lot.

Mountain Time,Joe Bonamassa,"You drive West on 80 and it won't take too long, 'Til the road starts climbing up to mountain time. There's a girl I know there, she lives free and easy, And she shows me wonders and she takes my mind. And she's wild as eagles, She's as sweet as honeysuckle, Her life's flowing like a mountain stream. And she takes me somewhere, And it's good to be there, And she pulls me into her bright golden wing. Now I hate the city and I love the country, And I love that feeling on that mountain high. And that girl is waiting, but she won't wait too long, So I drive all night to that clear blue sky. And she's wild as eagles, She's as sweet as honeysuckle, Her life's flowing like a mountain stream. And she takes me somewhere, And it's good to be there, And she pulls me into her bright golden wing.

Ah loddle doddle woof woof woof, hep hep hep, chopp chop chop, dig dig dig. Good evening friends.",https://www.letras.mus.br/ray-charles/730819/

Tragando a Indiferença,Murillo Augustus,"Tudo que ele tinha era um cigarro, filado ali no parapeito Pra tragar a indiferença de quem dizia que ele não tem jeito Seguiu sem rumo ou outro fumo, encarando aquela tempestade Quando não há pra onde ir, seguir é sempre uma necessidade De ganhar a fita, deu pra ver que era um cara sangue bom Ele queria ter ficado ali do lado pra curtir um som Na gaita se atentou, vibrou no solo de Blowin’ in the Wind Depois agradeceu e ofereceu um gesto paz e amor no fim Siga o seu caminho, eu falo só por mim Talvez você queira viver assim É presunção vazia, de quem tem seus penhores Pensar que grana alguma alivia as dores","All he had was a cigarette, sitting there on the railing To swallow the indifference of those who said he was hopeless He continued aimlessly or another smoke, facing that storm When there is nowhere to go, following is always a necessity To win the ribbon , I could tell he was a good-natured guy He wished he had stayed there to enjoy the sound On the harmonica he paid attention, he vibrated in the solo of Blowin' in the Wind Then he thanked and offered a gesture of peace and love at the end Follow your path , I speak only for myself Maybe you want to live like this It's an empty presumption, of those who have their pawns Thinking that no amount of money alleviates the pain",https://www.letras.mus.br/murillo-augustus/tragando-a-indiferenca/

It's Probably Me,Eric Clapton,"If the night turned cold and the stars looked down And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground. You wake the morning in a stranger's coat, No one would you see. You ask yourself, who'd watch for me? My only friend, who could it be? It's hard to say it, I hate to say it, but it's probably me. When your belly's empty and the hunger's so real And you're too proud to beg and too dumb to steal, You search the city for your only friend, No one would you see. You ask yourself, who'd watch for me? A solitary voice to speak out and set me free. I hate to say it, I hate to say it, but it's probably me. You're not the easiest person I ever got to know And it's hard for us both to let our feelings show. Some would say I should let you go your way, You'll only make me cry. But if there's one guy, just one guy Who'd lay down his life for you and die, I hate to say it, I hate to say it, but it's probably me. When the world's gone crazy and it makes no sense And there's only one voice that comes to your defense. The jury's out and your eyes search the room And one friendly face is all you need to see. And if there's one guy, just one guy Who'd lay down his life for you and die, I hate to say it, I hate to say it, but it's probably me. I hate to say it, I hate to say it, but it's probably me...","If the night turned cold and the stars looked down And you hug yourself on the cold cold ground.

Let The Mermaids Flirt With Me,Mississippi John Hurt,"Blues all on the ocean, blues all in the air; Can't stay here no longer, I have no steamship fare. When my earthly trials are over, cast my body out in the sea; Save on the undertaker bill-- let the mermaids flirt with me! I do not work for pleasure; earthly peace I'll see no more; The only reason I work at all is to drive the wolf from my door. When my earthly trials are over, cast my body out in the sea; Save on the undertaker bill-- let the mermaids flirt with me! My wife controls our happy home; my sweetheart I cannot find. The only thing I can call my own is a troubled and a worried mind. When my earthly trials are over, cast my body out in the sea; Save on the undertaker bill-- let the mermaids flirt with me!

Pilgrim,Eric Clapton,"And how do I choose and where do I draw the line Between truth and necessary pain? And how do I know and where do I get my belief That things will be all right again?

Olhe Sempre Pro Lado Bom da Vida,Monty Python,"Sabe o que eles dizem? Algumas coisas na vida são ruins... Podem de fato deixá-lo louco. Outras podem deixá-lo muito triste também, mas Quando sua vida estiver de sobreaviso Não resmungue! Dê um sorriso E só isso vai fazer tudo melhorar E olhe sempre pro lado bom da vida Olhe sempre pro lado bom da vida... Se ela estiver no fim é porque é mesmo assim E só isso é motivo pra sorrir Ao se sentir chateado, não fique falando de lado Assovie que o melhor está por vir E olhe sempre pro lado bom da vida Olhe sempre pro lado bom da vida Vamos! Olhe sempre pro lado bom da vida Pois a vida é um absurdo Não se deve ficar mudo Pensando nas coisas que perdeu Dê um sorriso, toca em frente Que atrás vem gente Veja o mundo como sempre seu E olhe sempre pro lado bom da morte E vai ver que é tudo um jogo de sorte Que seu último suspiro seja um cochilo Você verá que é tudo mesmo um show Que a vida é engraçada e a morte é uma piada Uma brincadeira que acabou E olhe sempre pro lado bom da vida Olhe sempre pro lado bom da vida Olhe sempre pro lado bom da vida Olhe sempre pro lado bom da vida Brian, faça as coisas bem mais simples. O que que você tem a perder? Olha, você veio do nada... vai voltar pro nada O que que você vai perder? Nada! Nada virá do nada, já diziam Ânimo, amigo, ânimo que o filme já tá no fim Agora eu disse, hein Eu avisei que este filme não ia dar lucro nenhum Eu disse pra eles O filme acaba, mas a música taí Por isso... compra o disquinho! Compre o disquinho! A música não é boa? Compra o disquinho!","Do you know what they say? Some things in life are bad... They can actually drive you crazy. Others can make you very sad too, but When your life is on the line Don't grumble! Give a smile And that alone will make everything better And always look on the good side of life Always look on the good side of life... If it's at the end, it's because that's how it is And that alone is a reason to smile When you feel upset, Don't talk sideways Whistle that the best is yet to come And always look on the bright side of life Always look on the bright side of life Let's go! Always look on the bright side of life Because life is absurd You shouldn't remain silent Thinking about the things you've lost Give a smile, move forward That people are behind you See the world as always yours And always look on the bright side of death And go see that it's all a game of luck May your last breath be a nap You'll see that it's all just a show That life is funny and death is a joke A joke that's over And always look on the bright side of life Always look on the side good in life Always look on the good side of life Always look on the good side of life Brian, make things much simpler. What do you have to lose? Look, you came from nothing... you're going back to nothing What are you going to lose? Anything! Nothing will come from nothing, as they said Cheer up, friend, cheer up because the film is already over Now I said, huh I warned you that this film wasn't going to make any profit I told them The film is over, but the music is still That's why... . buy the disc!

Londonderry Air (Danny Boy),Paul Robeson,"Oh, danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling From glen to glen, and down the mountain side.

Over The Hills And Far Away,Gary Moore,"They came for him one winter's night. Arrested, he was bound. They said there'd been a robbery, his pistol had been found. They marched him to the station house, he waited till the dawn. And as they led him to the dock, he knew that he'd been wronged. ""You stand accused of robbery,"" he heard the bailiff say. He knew without an alibi, tomorrow's light would mourn his freedom. Over the hills and far away, for ten long years he'll count the days. Over the mountains and the seas, a prisoner's life for him there'll be. He knew that it would cost him dear, but yet he dare not say. Just where he'd been that fateful night, a secret it must stay. He had to fight back tears of rage. His heart beat like a drum. For with the wife of his best friend, he spent his final night of freedom. Over the hills and far away, he swears he will return one day. Far from the mountains and the seas, back in her arms again he'll be. Over the hills and far away. Over the hills and, over the hills and, over the hills and far away. Each night within his prison cell, he looks out through the bars. He reads the letters that she wrote. One day he'll know the taste of freedom. Over the hills and far away, she prays he will return one day. As sure as the rivers reach the seas, back in his arms again she'll be. Over the hills and far away, he swears he will return one day. As sure as the river reach the seas, back in his arms is where she'll be. Over the hills and far away, she prays he will return one day.

Stranger In a Strange Land,Leon Russell,"How many days has it been  Since I was born? How many days until I die? Do I know any ways that I can make you laugh Or do I only know how to make you cry? When the baby looks around him It's such a sight to see He shares a simple secret With the wise man He's a stranger in a strange land Just a stranger in a strange land Tell me why He's a stranger in a strange land Just a stranger in a strange land How many miles will it take To see the Sun? And how many years until it's done? Kiss my confusion away in the night Lay by my side when the morning comes And the baby looks around him And shares his bed of hay With the burrow in the palace of the king He's a stranger in a strange land Tell me why He's a stranger in a strange land Just a stranger in a strange land Well, I don't exactly know What's going on in the world today Don't know what there is to say About the way the people are treating Each other, not like brothers Leaders take us far away from ecology With mythology and astrology Has got some words to say About the way we live today Why can't we learn to love each other? It's time to turn a new face To the whole world wide human race Stop the money chase Lay back, relax Get back on the human track Stop racing toward oblivion Oh, such a sad, sad state we're in And that's a thing Do you recognize the bells of truth When you hear them ring? Won't you stop and listen To the children sing? Won't you come on and sing it, children?

I didn't know what time it was you hold my hand. Warm like the month of May it was, and I'll say it was grand. Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad, to be yours alone! Grand tosee your face, feel your touch, hear your voice say I'm all your own. I didn't know what time it was live was no prize. I wanted love and here it was shining out of your eyes. I'm wise, and I know what time it is now. VERSE 2 Once I was old -- Twenty years or so -- rather well preserved: the wrinkles did't show. Once I was old, but not too old for fun. I used to hunt for little girls up my immaginary gun. But now I ain for only one! REFRAIN I didn't know what time it was then I met you. Oh, what a lovely time it was, How sublime it was too!

Eu te peço um verso,Simona Talma,"Eu te peço um verso  E você me vem com muito mais  Do que te peço Te dou uma canção  E você me vem como quem tem  Nas mãos esse caminho azul Lindo caminho azul pra mim Do não ao sim Voltas, saltos, abismos.  Canções cheia de intenções  Do sim ao não Carícias, carências, gestos indevidos. O que é que eu faço agora  Se me falta ar Se tu não pode ser  E eu não posso estar Se me pinto vinho  É pra me contentar  Em ter tua companhia Teu jeito de me amar Eu te pedi um dia  E você me deu o resto da minha vida Brilho, festas, plumas, flashes Mas eu fiquei deserta  Diante das grades abertas Depois virei vento, terra, água e nunca fogo.  Signo que não combina com o meu Terra para pés no chão Água para salvação Vento para me levar de ti Fogo para o coração.","I ask you for a verse And you come to me with much more Than what I ask of you I give you a song And you come to me as if you have this blue path In your hands Beautiful blue path for me From no to yes Turns, leaps, abysses.  Songs full of intentions From yes to no Caresses, needs, inappropriate gestures. What do I do now If I lack air If you can't be And I can't be If I paint myself with wine Is it to be content In having your company Your way of loving me I asked you one day And you gave me the rest of my life Shine, parties, feathers, flashes But I was left deserted Before the open bars Then I became wind, earth, water and never fire.  Sign that doesn't match mine Earth for feet on the ground Water for salvation Wind to take me away from you Fire for the heart.",https://www.letras.mus.br/simona-talma/1489953/

If you give me a chance, I'll try. You see it's been hard the road I'm traveling on, and if I take your hand I might lead you down the path to ruin. I've had a hard life-just saying so you understand that right now, right now I'm doing the best that I can at this point in my life. At this point in my life, although I've mostly walked in the shadows, I'm still searching for light. Won't you put your faith in me? We both know that's what matters. If you give me a chance, I'll try. You see, I've been climbing stairs, but mostly stumbling down. I've been reaching high but mostly losing ground. You see I've conquered hills but I still have mountains to climb and right now, right now, I'm doing the best I can at this point in my life. Before we take a step, before we walk down the path, before I make any promises, before you have regrets, before we talk commitment, let me tell you of my past-all I've seen and all I've done, the things I'd like to forget at this point in my life. At this point in my life, I'd like to live as if only love mattered, as if redemption was in sight, as if the search to live honestly is all that anyone needs, no matter if you find it. You see when I've touched the sky, the earth's gravity has pulled me down. But now I've reconciled that in this world, birds and angels get the wings to fly. If you can believe in this heart of mine, if you can give it a try, then I'll reach inside and find and give you all the sweetness that I have at this point in my life, at this point in my life.","At this point in my life, I've done so many things wrong I don't know if I can do right.

Mists Of Time,John Mayall,Somewhere in the world Are friends I've missed from long ago Could be drifting by the wayside Or even dead - I just don't know And now my memories are fading Like melting footprints in the snow Sometimes a dream will haunt me And I see a young girl's face Was she once for real And did she really share my space Within the swirling mists of time It's hard to keep a track of year and place I thought about my mother When she was young and on the road Hanging out with my musicians Or camping out in forest groves Like gray mists conceal horizons I miss those times we'll share no more So far my life's a journey And I wouldn't change for anything All those years of bold adventures The highs and lows that make me sing Within the swirling mists of time Such sweet memories sitll often ring,Somewhere in the world Are friends I've missed from long ago Could be drifting by the wayside Or even dead - I just don't know And now my memories are fading Like melting footprints in the snow Sometimes a dream will haunt me And I see a young girl's face Was she once for real And did she really share my space Within the swirling mists of time It's hard to keep a track of year and place I thought about my mother When she was young and on the road Hanging out with my musicians Or camping out in forest groves Like gray mists conceal horizons I miss those times we'll share no more So far my life's a journey And I wouldn't change for anything All those years of bold adventures The highs and lows that make me sing Within the swirling mists of time Such sweet memories sitll often ring,https://www.letras.mus.br/john-mayall/mists-of-time/
Todo Meu Amor,Mellizza,"Todo meu amor Durante muito tempo pensei, Em deixar você partir Mais não dá Seu cheiro ainda está aqui Eu posso ter errado não sei Mais nunca quis alguém como eu te quis Os meus olhos dizem tudo que fiz Eu queria que você pensasse Queria que você me quisesse Queria que você aceitasse Todo meu amor Eu posso ter errado não sei Mais nunca quis alguém como eu te quis Meus olhos dizem tudo que fiz Eu queria que você pensasse Queria que você me quisesse Queria que você aceitasse Todo meu amor 4x Não estou sendo sincera Nunca me vi desse jeito O tempo passa e leva a imagem que eu tinha aqui dentro Um sentimento tão puro um amor verdadeiro Atitudes insanas que rasgaram a dor no meu peito.","All my love For a long time I thought about letting you go But I can't Your smell is still here I could have been wrong I don't know But I never wanted someone like I wanted you My eyes say everything I did I wanted you to think I wanted you to me I wanted you to accept All my love I may have been wrong I don't know But I never wanted someone like I wanted you My eyes say everything I did I wanted you to think I wanted you to want me I wanted you to accept All my love 4x I'm not being sincere I never saw myself this way Time passes and takes away the image I had inside A feeling so pure, true love Insane attitudes that tore the pain in my chest.",https://www.letras.mus.br/mellizza/todo-meu-amor/

Io vorrei riprovarci ancora, io vorrei ma non so se tu lo vuoi. Quante cose ho bisogno di dirti ancora, non possiamo lasciare tutto a metà. Questo amore ci appartiene dal profondo basta chiedere. Ma io vorrei salutarti ancora, io vorrei respirarti ancora, io vorrei fare tutto questo se lo vuoi. Ho bisogno di dirti che sto da solo, non c'è stata nessuna dopo di te. Mentre il vento mi asciuga il viso da una lacrima che c'è, sto pensando che è lo stesso vento che accarezza te. Io vorrei riprovarci ancora, io vorrei ma non so se tu lo vuoi. Se lasciamo parlare ogni tanto il cuore, viene fuori da sola la verità. Non c'è amore senza piccoli dolori che ci cambiano. Ma io vorrei rivederti ancora, io vorrei accompagnarti ancora, io vorrei fare tutto questo se lo vuoi...","Ho bisogno di dirti che si sta male, è una vita da schifo se non ci sei e mi trovo col mio disordine nel cuore senza te, scatoloni pieni di ricordi che non vanno via.

I vorrei riprovarci ancora, io vorrei ma non so se tu lo vuoi. When we sew the bottom of the anchor, we couldn't tear it all away. Questo amore ci appartiene dal profondo simply chiedere. May I vorrei salutarti ancora, I will vorrei breatheti ancora, I will vorrei far everything question if lo vuoi. Ho bisogno di dirti che sto da solo, non c'è stata nessuna dopo di te.

Fever,Etta James,"Never know how much i love you, never know how much i care When you put your arms around me, i get a fever that's so hard To bear You give me fever - when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight Fever - in the the morning, fever all through the night.

Everybody's got the fever, that is something you all know Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago. Romeo loved juliet, juliet she felt the same When he put his arms around her, he said ""julie baby you're My flame"" Thou givest fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming Youth Fever - i'm on fire, fever yea i burn forsooth. Captain smith and pocahontas had a very mad affair When her daddy tried to kill him, she said ""daddy-o don't you dare"" Give me fever - with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight Fever - i'm his missus, oh daddy won't you treat him right. Now you've listened to my story, here's the point i have made: Chicks were born to give you fever, be it fahrenheit or Centigrade They give you fever - when you kiss them, fever if you live And learn Fever - till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn.

Invadiste os meus sentidos O que não fiz por amor E deixaste a minha vida Meio perdida Neste beco sem saída.. Dei-te quase tudo E quase tudo foi demais Dei-te quase tudo Leva agora os teus sinais...(2x) Obrigaste-me a quebrar Todas as leis E deixaste-me ao sabor Na loucura Dei-te os dedos e os anéis E o que tinha de melhor...

Lucille,B.B. King,"The sound that you're listening to is from my guitar that's named Lucille. I'm very crazy about Lucille. Lucille took me from the plantation. Oh you might say, brought me fame. I don't think I could just talk enough about Lucille. Sometime when I'm blue seem like Lucille try to help me call my name. I used to sing spirituals and I thought that this was the thing that I wanted to do. But somehow or other when I went in the army I picked up on Lucille, and started singing blues. Well, now when I'm paying my dues, maybe you don't know what I mean when I say paying dues, I mean when things are bad with me. I can always, I can always, you know like, depend on Lucille. Sort of hard to talk to you myself. I guess I'll let Lucille say a few words and then. You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do. But when I think about the things that I've gone through, like, well for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she misuses me, and I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely, well not maybe, I am lonely, I pick up Lucille and it bring out those funny sounds that sound good to me, you know. Sometime I get to the place where I can't even say nothing. Look out. Sometime I think it's crying. You know, if I could sing pop tunes like Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Junior, I don't think I still could do it, 'cause Lucille don't wanna play nothing but the blues. I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that. Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille. Sing, Lucille. Well, I'll put it like this. Take it easy, Lucille. I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings, but I can get a little Frank, Sammy, a little Ray Charles, in fact all the people with soul in this. A little Mahalia Jackson in there. One more, Lucille! Take it easy now. You know, I imagine a lot of you wanna know, a lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar Lucille. Lucille has practically saved my life two or three times. No kidding, it really has. I remember once I was in an automobile accident, and when the car stopped turning over, it fell over on Lucille, and it held it up off me, really, it held it up off me. So that's one time it saved my life. The way, the way I came by the name of Lucille, I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you've never heard of that one, have you? And one night the guys started a ball over there, you know, they started brawling, you know what I mean. And the guy that was mad with his old lady, when she fell over on this gas tank that was burning for heat, the gas ran all over the floor. And when the gas ran all over the floor, the building caught on fire, and almost burned me up trying to save Lucille. Oh I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille, the lady that started that brawl that night was named Lucille. And that's been Lucille ever since to me. One more now, Lucille. Sounds pretty good to me. Can I do one more? Look out, Lucille. Sounds pretty good. I think I'll try one more. All right.","The sound that you're listening to is from my guitar that's named Lucille.
