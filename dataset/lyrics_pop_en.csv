La Solitudine,Laura Pausini,"Marco se n'è andato e non ritorna più E il treno delle 7: 30 senza lui È un cuore di metallo senza l'anima Nel freddo del mattino grigio di città A scuola il banco è vuoto, Marco è dentro me È dolce il suo respiro fra i pensieri miei Distanze enormi sembrano dividerci Ma il cuore batte forte dentro me Chissà se tu mi penserai Se con i tuoi non parli mai Se ti nascondi come me Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi mangiare Stringi forte a te il cuscino Piangi e non lo sai quanto altro male ti farà la solitudine Marco nel mio diario ho una fotografia Hai gli occhi di bambino un poco timido La stringo forte al cuore e sento che ci sei Fra i compiti d'inglese e matematica Tuo padre e i suoi consigli, che monotonia Lui con il suo lavoro ti ha portato via Di certo, il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai Ha detto: Un giorno tu mi capirai Chissà se tu mi penserai Se con gli amici parlerai Per non soffrire più per me Ma non è facile lo sai A scuola non ne posso più E i pomeriggi senza te Studiare è inutile, tutte le idee si affollano su te Non è possibile dividere la vita di noi due Ti prego aspettami amore mio Ma illuderti non so! La solitudine fra noi Questo silenzio dentro me È l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te Ti prego aspettami perché Non posso stare senza te Non è possibile dividere la storia di noi due La solitudine fra noi Questo silenzio dentro me È l'inquietudine di vivere la vita senza te Ti prego aspettami perché Non posso stare senza te Non è possibile dividere la storia di noi due la solitudine","Marco is not alone and does not come back again, And the train of the 7: 30 senza lui is a cuore di metallo senza l'anima In the early morning morning grigio di citte The school at the bank is seen, Marco is inside me and sweet in his sweat I breathe from my pensieri miei A huge distance between me and my heart, but when I'm strong inside me I'll cry if you think about me If you don't speak to me, if you can't come close to me, Sfuggi gli sguardi e te ne stai Rinchiuso in camera e non vuoi mangiare Stringi forte a I have my cuscino Piangi and it doesn't come out as much as I can do the solitudine Marco in my diary or a photograph I saw the bambino a little shy The string is strong in my heart and I feel like I know I compete in English and mathematics Your father and I suoi consigli, che monotonia Lui con il suo laboro ti ha portato via Di Certo, il tuo parere non l'ha chiesto mai Ha detto: Un giorno tu mi capirai Chissà se tu mi falerai Se con gli amici parlerai Per non soffrire più per But it's not easy for me to leave A scuola doesn't need to be done and I can't do it again.

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song A young girl with eyes like the desert It all seems like yesterday, not far away Tropical the island breeze All of nature wild and free This is where I long to be La Isla Bonita And when the samba played The Sun would set so high Ring through my ears and sting my eyes Your Spanish lullaby I fell in love with San Pedro Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me Te dijo: Te amo I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast Tropical the island breeze All of nature wild and free This is where I long to be La Isla Bonita And when the samba played The Sun would set so high Ring through my ears and sting my eyes Your Spanish lullaby I want to be where the Sun warms the sky When it's time for siesta, you can watch them go by Beautiful faces, no cares in this world Where a girl loves a boy and a boy loves a girl Last night I dreamt of San Pedro It all seems like yesterday, not far away Tropical the island breeze All of nature wild and free This is where I long to be La Isla Bonita And when the samba played The Sun would set so high Ring through my ears and sting my eyes Your Spanish lullaby Tropical the island breeze All of nature wild and free This is where I long to be La Isla Bonita And when the samba played The Sun would set so high Ring through my ears and sting my eyes Your Spanish lullaby (La-la-la-la-la-la-la) Te dijo: Te amo (La-la-la-la-la-la-la) Él dijo que te ama (La Isla Bonita) (Spanish lullaby)","How could it be true?

Xona No Peão,Brenno e Matheus,Hoje na roça vai ter bailão Várias novinhas descendo no chão Eu tô na pose De copão na mão Dia de maldade e confusão Putariazinha no paredão Fazendo close com meu chapelão Lingerie brotando aqui Nã nã nã nã não responde pra mim Como é que não xona no peão Como é que não xona no peão A cara de mal e quase um quilo de cordão Como é que não xona no peão Como é que não xona no peão Elas se amarra na pegada com pressão Como é que não xona no peão Como é que não xona no peão A cara de mal e quase um quilo de cordão Como é que não xona no peão Como é que não xona no peão Elas se amarra na pegada com pressão,Today in the countryside there will be a dance Lot of young girls getting down on the ground I'm in a pose With a cup in my hand A day of mischief and confusion Little whore on the wall Taking a close-up with my big hat Lingerie sprouting here No no no no no answer to me How come you don't swoon at the pedestrian How do you not squeal on the pedestrian? The evil face and almost a kilo of cord? How do you not squeal on the pedestrian? on the pawn The evil face and almost a kilo of cord How do you not pussy on the pawn How do you not pussy on the pawn They tie themselves to the grip with pressure,https://www.letras.mus.br/brenno-e-matheus/xona-no-peao/
Câmera Frontal (part. Ferrugem),Gloria Groove,"Fiquei sabendo por um amigo De um amigo seu que você tá bem Pedi pra uma amiga de uma amiga Sair espalhando que eu tô bem também Tô postando foto mais do que o normal Só não tô usando a câmera frontal Pra ninguém saber que eu andei chorando Uma selfie acabaria com meu plano Tô vivo mas não tô vivendo Tô sofrendo e disfarçando Se eu que terminei sorrindo Como é que eu vou voltar aos prantos? Eu olho pra outros casais E tento entender os sinais Eu lembro que a gente era assim, feliz Eu olho pra outros casais E não tenho um minuto de paz Eu sinto saudade de nós Mas sinto que é tarde demais Pra pedir perdão Pedir pra morar de novo no seu coração","I found out from a friend From a friend of yours that you're fine I asked a friend of a friend Go out and spread the word that I'm fine too I'm posting more photos than usual I'm just not using the front camera So no one knows I've been crying One selfie would end my plan I'm alive but I'm not living I'm suffering and hiding it If I ended up smiling How will I go back to crying? I look at other couples And I try to understand the signs I remember that we were like this, happy I look at other couples And I don't have a minute of peace I miss us But I feel like it's too late To ask for forgiveness Ask to live again in your heart",https://www.letras.mus.br/gloria-groove/camera-frontal-part-ferrugem/

Cinderela,Carlos Paião,"Eles são duas crianças a viver esperanças, a saber sorrir Ela tem cabelos louros, ele tem tesouros para repartir Numa outra brincadeira passam mesmo à beira, sempre sem falar Uns olhares envergonhados e são namorados sem ninguém pensar Foram juntos outro dia, como por magia, no autocarro, em pé Ele lá lhe disse, a medo: O meu nome é Pedro e o teu qual é? Ela corou um pouquinho e respondeu baixinho: Sou a Cinderela Quando a noite o envolveu ele adormeceu e sonhou com ela Então Bate, bate coração! Louco, louco de ilusão! A idade assim não tem valor Crescer Vai dar tempo p'ra aprender Vai dar jeito p'ra viver O teu primeiro amor Cinderela das histórias, a avivar memórias, a deixar mistério Já o fez andar na lua, no meio da rua e a chover a sério Ela, quando lá o viu, encharcado e frio, quase o abraçou Com a cara assim molhada, ninguém deu por nada, ele até chorou Então Bate, bate coração! Louco, louco de ilusão! A idade assim não tem valor Crescer Vai dar tempo p'ra aprender Vai dar jeito p'ra viver O teu primeiro amor E agora, nos recreios, dão os seus passeios, fazem muitos planos E dividem a merenda, tal como uma prenda que se dá nos anos E, num desses bons momentos, houve sentimentos a falar por si Ele pegou na mão dela: Sabes Cinderela, eu gosto de ti Então Bate, bate coração! Louco, louco de ilusão! A idade assim não tem valor Crescer Vai dar tempo p'ra aprender Vai dar jeito p'ra viver O teu primeiro amor Cinderela Então Bate, bate coração! Louco, louco de ilusão!

She blushed a little and replied softly: I'm Cinderella When the night enveloped him he fell asleep and dreamed of her Then Beat, beat heart! Crazy, crazy with illusion! Age like this has no value Growing up There will be time to learn It will be useful to live Your first love Cinderella of stories, reviving memories, leaving mystery She has already made him walk on the moon, in the middle of the street and in the rain seriously She, when she saw him there, soaked and cold, almost hugged him With his face so wet, no one noticed anything, he even cried So Beat, beat heart! Crazy, crazy with illusion! Age like this has no value Growing up There will be time to learn It will be useful to live Your first love And now, at recess, they take their walks, make lots of plans And share the snack, just like a gift that is it takes years And, in one of those good moments, there were feelings speaking for themselves He took her hand: You know Cinderella, I like you So Beat, beat heart! Crazy, crazy with illusion! Age like this has no value Growing up There will be time to learn It will be useful to live Your first love Cinderella So Beat, beat heart! Crazy, crazy with illusion!

A Lenda,Sandy & Junior,"Bem lá no céu uma Lua existe Vivendo só no seu mundo triste O seu olhar sobre a terra lançou E veio procurando por amor Então o mar, frio e sem carinho Também cansou de ficar sozinho Sentiu na pele aquele brilho tocar E pela Lua foi se apaixonar Luz que banha a noite E faz o Sol adormecer Mostra como eu amo você Se a lenda dessa paixão Faz sorrir ou faz chorar O coração é quem sabe Se a Lua toca no mar Ela pode nos tocar Pra dizer que o amor não se acabe Se cada um faz a sua história A nossa pode ser feliz também Se um coração diz que sim à paixão Como pode o outro dizer não? Luz que banha a noite E faz o Sol adormecer Mostra como eu amo você Se a lenda dessa paixão Faz sorrir ou faz chorar O coração é quem sabe Se a Lua toca no mar Ela pode nos tocar Pra dizer que o amor não se acabe Se a lenda dessa paixão Faz sorrir ou faz chorar O coração é quem sabe Se a Lua toca no mar Ela pode nos tocar Pra dizer que o amor não se acabe Se a lenda dessa paixão Faz sorrir ou faz chorar O coração é quem sabe Se a Lua toca no mar Ela pode nos tocar Pra dizer que o amor não se acabe","Well there in the sky there is a Moon Living alone in your sad world His gaze cast over the earth And he came looking for love Then the sea, cold and without affection He was also tired of being alone He felt that glow touch his skin And he fell in love with the Moon Light that bathes the night And makes the Sun fall asleep Shows how I love you If the legend of this passion Makes you smile or makes you cry The heart is the one who knows If the Moon touches the sea It can touch us To say that love does not end If each one makes its own story Ours can be happy too If one heart says yes to passion How can the other say no? Light that bathes the night And makes the Sun fall asleep Shows how I love you If the legend of this passion Makes you smile or makes you cry The heart is the one who knows If the Moon touches the sea She can touch us To say that love does not end If the legend of this passion Makes you smile or makes you cry The heart is the one who knows If the Moon touches the sea It can touch us To say that love doesn't end If the legend of this passion Makes you smile or makes you cry The heart is the one who knows If the Moon touches in the sea She can touch us To say that love does not end",https://www.letras.mus.br/sandy-e-junior-musicas/a-lenda/

Nothing New (feat. Phoebe Bridgers),Taylor Swift,"They tell you while you're young Girls, go out and have your fun Then they hunt and slay the ones Who actually do it Criticize the way you fly When you're soaring through the sky Shoot you down and then they sigh and say She looks like she's been through it Lord, what will become of me Once I've lost my novelty? I've had too much to drink tonight And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about And I wake up in the middle of the night It's like I can feel time moving How can a person know everything at 18 But nothing at 22? And will you still want me When I'm nothing new? How long will it be cute All this crying in my room? When you can't blame it on my youth And roll your eyes with affection And my cheeks are growing tired From turning red and faking smiles Are we only biding time 'Til I lose your attention? And someone else lights up the room People love an ingénue I've had (I've had) Too much to drink tonight How did I go from growing up to breaking down? And I wake up (wake up) In the middle of the night It's like I can feel time moving How can a person know everything at 18 But nothing at 22? And will you still want me When I'm nothing new? I know someday I'm gonna meet her It's a fever dream The kind of radiance you only have at 17 She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me I'll say I'm happy for her Then I'll cry myself to sleep Oh, oh I've had (I've had) Too much to drink tonight But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out I wake up (wake up) In the middle of the night And I can feel time moving How can a person know everything at 18 But nothing at 22?

O Dom da Vida,Gloria Groove,"Como é que pode alguém que vem voando de longe De um lugar tão distante, vim pousar aqui? Só pra me ensinar a sorrir Como é pode ter tanta gente no mundo E foi só um segundo pra eu me entender Tinha que ser você E quanto mais eu voo e volto pra casa Mais eu quero morar nos teus braços, teus braços Voando com você eu descobri a liberdade Foi como flutuar e contemplando a paisagem Depois que eu te beijei não tive medo e nem saída Amor como você sempre revela o dom da vida, é vida Só sei o meu caminho, se eu volto pro seu ninho","How can someone who comes flying from afar From such a distant place come to land here? Just to teach me how to smile What it's like to have so many people in the world And it was just a second for me to understand myself It had to be you And the more I fly and return home The more I want to live in your arms, your arms Flying with you I I discovered freedom It was like floating and contemplating the landscape After I kissed you I had no fear and no way out Love like you always reveals the gift of life, it's life I only know my path, if I return to your nest",https://www.letras.mus.br/gloria-groove/o-dom-da-vida/

6x1 - Barcelona: O Impossível Não Existe,FutParódias,"Quando eu lembro, até me arrepio A virada era uma missão impossível Talvez pareça um roteiro de Hollywood Começa em Paris com o Barça parecendo outro clube Quatro a zero, uma noite de dor E do Barça o mundo desacreditou Mas o impossível não há Quando se trata de Barça E o Messi encontrou um jeito Pra que alguém salvasse o dia Passou a coroa pro Neymar Falou: Brilhe com ela Meunier, ninguém te avisou? Menino Neymar é fera Menino Neymar é fera Um PSG covarde e medroso Foi o Roth que escalou o time pra jogo? Acho melhor cês pedir um Playstation pro Yudi Lá já cheguei na final da Champions com o Toulouse Quem ia mesmo ver a Champions da poltrona? Enquanto ouvia mais um gol do Barcelona Pois o impossível não há Quando se trata de Barça O freguês amarelou Cadê você, Di María? E tá liberado chorar Unai cancela a festa Cavani, ninguém te avisou? Menino Neymar é fera Menino Neymar é fera Mas o impossível não há Quando se trata de Barça Esse 6 a 1 foi o preço Que foi pago com maestria Então valeu acreditar E até fazer promessa Verratti, ninguém te avisou? Menino Neymar é fera Neymar é fera Menino Neymar é fera","When I remember it, I even get goosebumps The comeback was an impossible mission Maybe it seems like a Hollywood script It starts in Paris with Barça looking like another club Four to zero, a night of pain And the world discredited Barça But there is no such thing as impossible When it comes to of Barça And Messi found a way For someone to save the day He passed the crown to Neymar He said: Shine with it Meunier, didn't anyone warn you? Boy Neymar is a beast Boy Neymar is a beast A cowardly and fearful PSG Was it Roth who selected the team for the game? I think you'd better ask Yudi for a Playstation. I already reached the Champions League final with Toulouse. Who would really watch the Champions League from their armchair? While listening to another Barcelona goal Because there is no such thing as impossible When it comes to Barça The customer turned yellow Where are you, Di María? And it's okay to cry. Unai cancels the Cavani party, didn't anyone tell you? Boy Neymar is a beast Boy Neymar is a beast But there is no such thing as impossible When it comes to Barça That 6-1 was the price That was paid with mastery So it was worth believing And until Verratti made a promise, no one warned you?

If We Have Each Other,Alec Benjamin,"She was 19 with a baby on the way On the Eastside of the city, she was working every day Cleaning dishes in the evening, she could barely stay awake She was clinging to the feeling that her luck was gonna change And 'cross town she would take the bus at night To a one bedroom apartment, and when she'd turn on the light She would sit down at the table, tell herself that it's alright She was waiting on the day that she hoped her baby would arrive She'd never be alone Have someone to hold And when nights were cold She'd say The world's not perfect but it's not that bad If we got each other and that's all we have I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand You should know I'll be there for you When the world's not perfect, when the world's not kind If we have each other then we'll both be fine I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand You should know I'll be there for you They were 90 and were living out their days On the Westside of the city next to where they got engaged They had pictures on the walls of all the memories that they made And though life was never easy, they were thankful that they stayed With each other and though some times were hard Even when she made him angry, he would never break her heart And they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart Even at the end Their love was stronger than The day that they first met They'd say The world's not perfect but it's not that bad If we got each other and that's all we have I will be your lover and I'll hold

one bedroom apartment, and when she'd turn on the light She would sit down at the table, tell herself that it's alright She was waiting on the day that she hoped her baby would arrive She'd never be alone Have someone to hold And when nights were cold She'd say The world's not perfect but it's not that bad If we got each other and that's all we have I will be your mother and I'll hold your hand

though life was never easy, they were thankful that they stayed With each other and though some times were hard Even when she made him angry, he would never break her heart And they didn't have the money to afford a fancy car But they never had to travel 'cause they'd never be apart Even at the end Their love was stronger than The day that they first met They'd say The world's not perfect but

9 Meses (Oração do Bebê),Bárbara Dias,"Um mês e o tempo voa Eu já sou E você nem descobriu São dois e chega perto Mas eu ainda sou Pequeno demais, viu? Três meses e o tormento Esse teu sofrimento Eu também já posso sentir Vê se aquieta o coração Pra quando eu sair daqui Talvez eu dê trabalho Uma vida de despesas Mas, por favor, me deixa ficar E se por um acaso Eu não tiver seus olhos Você ainda vai me amar Eu sei que a ansiedade É quase uma inimiga Mas eu não quero ser confusão Então, por favor Me deixa na sua vida Mas vê se aquieta o seu coração Se é tempestade, todo medo Se for arrependimento Por favor, tira daí Você ainda não me tem inteiro Nem me conhece direito Mas já posso te ouvir E quando a barriga for crescendo Você ainda vai ser linda Eu nem preciso te ver Seca o choro e fica aqui comigo Que até assim tristinha Eu já sei Que eu amo você! Quatro meses Tempo eu te imploro paciência Eu vim do céu por causa do amor No quinto faltam quatro E eu aposto que os presentes Já tão vindo em rosa ou azul E quando chega o sexto Todo mundo já vê Que você não anda sozinha No sétimo eu já tenho lencinhos com meu nome Desculpa pai, mas ela é só minha Se é tempestade, todo medo Se for arrependimento Por favor, tira daí Você ainda não me tem inteiro Nem me conhece direito Mas já posso te ouvir E quando a barriga for crescendo Você ainda vai ser linda Eu nem preciso te ver Seca o choro e fica aqui comigo Que até assim tristinha Eu já sei que eu amo você! Oitavo mês aguenta Que eu já tô chegando Só quero um jeito de te encontrar No nono vem a pressa A dor, o choro, a gente Desculpa você ter que sangrar E por mais uns anos Você vai fazer planos Pensando se eles servem pra mim E eu vou te acordar Bem de madrugada Você vai me amar mesmo assim O meu primeiro passo Vai ser no seu abraço Me segura quando eu cair E no final do dia só a tua voz Que vai poder me fazer dormir Se é tempestade, todo medo Se for arrependimento Por favor, tira daí Você ainda não me tem inteiro Nem me conhece direito Mas já posso te ouvir E quando a barriga for crescendo Você ainda vai ser linda Eu nem preciso te ver Seca o choro e fica aqui comigo Que até assim tristinha eu já sei Que eu amo você!","One month and time flies I already am And you haven't even discovered It's two and it's close But I'm still Too small, you know? Three months and the torment This suffering of yours I can feel it too See if my heart calms down For when I leave here Maybe I'll be hard work A life of expenses But, please, let me stay And if by chance I don't have your eyes You you will still love me I know that anxiety It's almost an enemy But I don't want to be a mess So please let me in your life But see if your heart calms down If it's a storm, all fear If it's regret Please take it away You You still don't have me whole You don't even know me well But I can already hear you And when your belly grows You'll still be beautiful I don't even need to see you Dry the crying and stay here with me That's even sad I already know That I love you! Four months Time I beg you for patience I came from heaven because of love In the fifth there are four more to go And I bet that the gifts Are already coming in pink or blue And when the sixth arrives Everyone already sees That you are not alone In the seventh I already I have tissues with my name Sorry dad, but she's just mine If it's a storm, all fear If it's regret Please take it away You still don't have me whole You don't even know me well But I can already hear you And when your belly gets bigger You still It's going to be beautiful I don't even need to see you Dry the crying and stay here with me Even so sad I already know that I love you! Eighth month can handle it I'm already arriving I just want a way to find you In the ninth comes the rush The pain, the crying, us I'm sorry you have to bleed And for a few more years You'll make plans Wondering if they're for me And me I will wake you up at dawn You will love me anyway My first step Will be in your embrace Hold me when I fall And at the end of the day only your voice That will be able to put me to sleep If it's a storm, all fear If it's regret Please, take it away You still don't have me whole You don't even know me well But I can already hear you And when your belly grows You'll still be beautiful I don't even need to see you Dry the crying and stay here with me How sad I already know how sad I am That I love you!",https://www.letras.mus.br/barbara-dias/9-meses-oracao-do-bebe/

(Ooh) what are you afraid of? If you ask for me Wait for the early morning sky Everything that begins ends I'll be there, colliding with the stars Crying their death I make time stop",https://www.letras.mus.br/jao/supernova/
I Am Not Who I Was,Chance Peña,"I've been living on the road Made a buck of my soul I've been singing stories to the crowd It's been a while since I've been home I think about you every night Wonder what it would've been like If I stuck around and settled down Maybe in another life So, if I fly too far Will I still have a place inside your heart? And, when you see what I've become Will you love me for who I am, not who I was? You keep me steady on the ground When my head's lost in the clouds That spotlight, though it shines bright Could never drown you out I know it's hard when I'm away I'll just hope you don't lose faith 'Cause I told the truth when I said to you That I'll be back someday So, if I fly too far Will I still have a place inside your heart?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh A string that pulled me Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire Chains around my demons Wool to brave the seasons A single thread of gold Tied me to you Cold was the steel of my ax to grind For the boys who broke my heart Now I send their babies gifts Gold was the color of the leaves When I showed you around Centennial Park Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven Time, wondrous time Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies And it's cool Baby, with me And isn't it just so pretty to think All along there was some Invisible string Tying you to me?

Timeless,Taylor Swift,"Down the block, there's an antique shop And something in my head said: Stop, so I walked in On the counter was a cardboard box And the sign said: Photos, twenty-five cents each Black and white, saw a thirties bride And school lovers laughing on the porch of their first house The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime The kind you don't put down And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain, but In those photos, I saw us instead And somehow I know that you and I would've found each other In another life, you still would've turned my head Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944 And you were headed off to fight in the war You still would've been mine, we would have been timeless I would've read your love letters every single night And prayed to God you'd be coming home all right And you would've been fine, we would have been timeless 'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this So, even in a different life You still would've been mine, we would've been timeless I had to smile when it caught my eye There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway Holding hands, on the way to a dance And the date on the back said 1958 Which brought me back to the first time I saw you Time stood still like something in this old shop I thought about it as I started looking 'round At these precious things that time forgot That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs Story of a romance torn apart by fate Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love like we did And I'd die for you in the same way If I first saw your face in the fifteen hundreds, off in a foreign land And I was forced to marry another man You still would've been mine, we would have been timeless I would've read your love letters every single night And run away and left it all behind You still would've been mine, we would've been timeless 'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this So, even in a different life You still would've been mine, we would've been timeless Time breaks down your mind and body Don't you let it touch your soul It was like an age-old classic The first time that you saw me The story started when you said: Hello In a crowded room, a few short years ago And sometimes there's no proof, you just know You're always gonna be mine, we're gonna be I'm gonna love you when our hair is turning grey We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made And you'll say: Oh my, we really were timeless We're gonna be timeless, timeless You still would've been mine, we would've been Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944 You still would've been mine, we would've been Down the block, there's an antique shop And something in my head said: Stop, so I walked in","Down the block, there's an antique shop And something in my head said: Stop, so I walked in On the counter was a cardboard box And the sign said: Photos, twenty-five cents each Black and white, saw a thirties bride And school lovers laughing on the porch of their first house The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime The kind you don't put down And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain, but In those photos, I saw us instead And somehow I know that you and I would've found each other In another life, you still would've turned my head Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944 And you were headed off to fight in the war You still would've been mine, we would have been timeless I would've read your love letters every single night And prayed to God you'd be coming home all right And you would've been fine, we would have been timeless 'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this So, even in a different life You still would've been mine, we would've been timeless I had to smile when it caught my eye There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway Holding hands , on the way to a dance And the date on the back said 1958 Which brought me back to the first time I saw you Time stood still like something in this old shop I thought about it as I started looking 'round At these precious things that time forgot That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs Story of a romance torn apart by fate Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love like we did And I'd die for you in the same way If I first saw your face in the fifteen hundred, off in a foreign land And I was forced to marry another

You know that song by Phil Collins In The Air Of The Night About that guy who could have saved that other guy from drowning But didn't? Then Phil saw it all, then at his show, he found him? That's kinda how this is, you could have rescued me from drowning Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I love you, Slim, we could have been together, think about it You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me See Slim, shut up, bitch, I'm trying to talk Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk But I didn't slit her throat I just tied her up, see, I ain't like you 'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now Oh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out? My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all And even if I could, it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph for your brother: I wrote it on your Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally, just to diss you And what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists, too? I say that shit just clownin', dawg c'mon, how fucked up is you?

Before You Go,Lewis Capaldi,"I fell by the wayside like everyone else I hate you, I hate you, I hate you But I was just kidding myself Our every moment, I start to replace 'Cause now that they're gone All I hear are the words that I needed to say When you hurt under the surface Like troubled water running cold Well, time can heal, but this won't So, before you go Was there something I could've said To make your heartbeat better? If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather So, before you go Was there something I could've said To make it all stop hurting? It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless So, before you go Was never the right time, whenever you called Went little by, little by, little until there was nothing at all Our every moment, I start to replay it But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face When you hurt under the surface Like troubled water running cold Well, time can heal, but this won't So, before you go Was there something I could've said To make your heartbeat better?

Amor Traumatizado,Carol Biazin,"Tem gente que já nasce com o coração blindado Pena que não é o meu caso Pena que não é o meu Pena que não é o meu caso Pena que não é o meu Já sofri e fiz sofrer Nem sei por que escolho se amar sempre vira doer Me prove o contrário, que dessa vez é pra valer Meu coração cansado só quer descansar em você Cuida do que nunca foi cuidado Pareço ser forte, mas sou frágil Aceita meu amor traumatizado?

Foda essa geração descartável, descontrole Vejo no repeat tanta inversão de valores Será que ainda existe amar em meio a desamores?

You hung me on your wall Stabbed me with your push pins In public, showed me off Then sank in stoned oblivion 'Cause once your queen had come You'd treat her likе an also-ran You didn't measure up In any measurе of a man And I don't even want you back, I just want to know If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give A message to the smallest man who ever lived? Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead? Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed? Were you writing a book? Were you a Sleeper Cell spy? In fifty years, will all this be declassified? And you'll confess why you did it And I'll say: Good riddance 'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden I would've died for your sins Instead, I just died inside And you deserve prison, but you won't get time You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars You crashed my party and your rental car You said normal girls were boring But you were gone by the morning You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing And in plain sight you hid But you are what you did And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive The smallest man who ever lived","Was any of it true?

Say You Won't Let Go,James Arthur,"I met you in the dark, you lit me up You made me feel as though I was enough We danced the night away, we drank too much I held your hair back when you were throwing up Then you smiled over your shoulder For a minute, I was stone cold sober I pulled you closer to my chest And you asked me to stay over I said: I already told ya I think that you should get some rest I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know 'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go I knew I needed you, but I never showed I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go I wake you up with some breakfast in bed I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night When you looked over your shoulder For a minute, I forget that I'm older I wanna dance with you right now, oh And you look as beautiful as ever And I swear that everyday you get better You make me feel this way somehow I'm so in love with you and I hope you know Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown And I wanna stay with you until we're grey and old Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go I wanna live with you Even when we're ghosts 'Cause you were always there for me When I needed you most I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out I promise till death we part, like in our vows So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows 'Cause that is just you and me until we're grey and old Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go Oh, just say you won't let go","I met you in the dark, you lit me up You made me feel as though I was enough We danced the night away, we drank too much I held your hair back when you were throwing up Then you smiled over your shoulder For a minute, I was stone cold sober I pulled you closer to my chest And you asked me to stay over I said: I already told ya I think that you should get some rest I knew I loved you then, but you'd never know 'Cause I played it cool when I was scared of letting go I knew I needed you, but I showed never I wanted to stay with you until we're gray and old Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go I wake you up with some breakfast in bed I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head And I'll take the kids to school, wave them goodbye And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night When you looked over your shoulder For a minute, I forget that I'm older I wanna dance with you right now, oh And you look as beautiful as ever And I swear that everyday you get better You make me feel this way somehow I'm so in love with you and I hope you know Darling, your love is more than worth its weight in gold We've come so far, my dear, look how we've grown And I wanna stay with you until we're gray and old Just say you won' t let go Just say you won't let go I wanna live with you Even when we're ghosts 'Cause you were always there for me When I needed you most I'm gonna love you till my lungs give out I promise till death we part, like in our vows So I wrote this song for you, now everybody knows 'Cause that is just you and me until we're gray and old Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go Just say you won't let go Oh, just say you won't let go",https://www.letras.mus.br/james-arthur/say-you-wont-let-go/
